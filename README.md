# Project Overview
<p align="justify">When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go. The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.</p>
<p align="justify">In this project lane lines are detected in images using Python and OpenCV. OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.</p>
<b><p align="justify">In the first step a software pipeline has been built to detect the lanelines in an image and then the software pipeline is now tested on a video footage and then the changes have been made according to the requirements to properly identify the lane lines in an image</p></b>
